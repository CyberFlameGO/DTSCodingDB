# DTSCodingDB
A repo for the project combining achievement in AS91906 &amp; AS91902


--- 

## Planning
##### Evidence needed:
* Iterative improvement proof (git commit history can be part of this, but perhaps tagging commits with what type of improvement it is, and/or using semantic commit messages)
  * Showing feature addition
  * Showing improvements made as a result of testing
  * Marking commits as minor when features are rough/the unpolished product (before the feature is complete).
* Relevant implications (finish off this whole list)

##### General to-do
* Finish repo config (pull off of AS91896 and AS91892 config files)
* Add .gitignore
