# DTSCodingDB
A repo for the project combining achievement in AS91906 &amp; AS91902


--- 

## Planning
##### Evidence needed:
* [ ] Iterative improvement proof (git commit history can be part of this, but perhaps tagging commits with what type of improvement it is, and/or using semantic commit messages)
  * Showing feature addition
  * Showing improvements made as a result of testing
  * Marking commits as minor when features are rough/the unpolished product (before the feature is complete)
* [ ] Relevant implications (finish off this whole list)
* [ ] Shown concept, as in, a demo of the final product
* [ ] Evidence of designation and considered implications of selected structure (just one thick docstring in my database logic class should do it)
* [ ] Evidence of data integrity/testing procedures (making sure SQL injection can't happen, and invalid, malformed, or otherwise malicious data is sanitised and/or rejected
* [ ] Evidence of queries (either by quote or by screenshot should be fine, and I can just comment a method or an instance of the method)
* [ ] Evidence of customized data displays (a subset of data and data sorting should do this, as well as showing the data in different formats)
* [ ] Showing that the database is dynamically linked to the display \(similar to how I used Jinja2 in [AS91892](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/AS91892) last year\)
* [ ] Showing data access - not too sure how I'll do this but I might restrict access in the code instead of on the database framework)
* [ ] Shwoing the use of multiple tables (relational)

##### General to-do
* [ ] Finish repo config (pull off of AS91896 and AS91892 config files)
* [ ] Add .gitignore
